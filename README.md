"Cathy" is a voice-controlled assistant using Python. It utilizes various libraries to enable speech recognition, text-to-speech synthesis, and interaction with YouTube and Wikipedia.
The assistant starts by introducing itself and waits for user commands. It continuously listens to the user's voice input through the microphone, recognizes the speech, and processes the commands accordingly.
